## EFT Flea Market Price Scanner

This tool is an **overlay assistant for Escape from Tarkov** to detect item names when you hover over them in-game.

It then queries **tarkov.dev’s GraphQL API** to fetch 
current flea market and trader prices.

### Keybinds
- **Release `Left Alt`** → Price lookup for the item under cursor

### Notes / Disclaimer
- **Use at your own risk** – this tool is not officially supported by Battlestate Games.
- The program only **reads pixels from your screen** and performs OCR.  
  It does not write memory, inject into the game, or send any input back to the client.
- Since it functions like a screen overlay, it *should not* result in a ban, but there are **no guarantees**.
